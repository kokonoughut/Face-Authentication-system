# Face Authentication System
Introduction
The face authentication system is a secure and convenient way for users to log into a website without the need to enter their password. 
The system uses a facial recognition technology to authenticate the user’s identity. The user can log into the website by simply showing their face to the camera. 
The system then compares the user’s face with the one that is stored in the database. If the face matches, the user is granted access to the website.

# Sameness Model
The system uses the sameness model for the recognition of stored user’s face.The sameness model uses one-shot learning to identify the unique features of the user’s face and compare them with the ones that are stored in the database . 
One-shot learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that compares the similarities and differences between two images. It is used in computer vision to solve problems where the model is given only one instance for training data and has to learn to re-identify that instance in the testing data. 
In the case of face identification, a model or system may only has one or a few examples of a given person’s face and must correctly identify the person from new photographs with changes to expression, hairstyle, lighting, accessories, and more .This ensures that the system can accurately identify the user’s face and grant access to the website.

# Benefits
The face authentication system is a secure and convenient way for users to log into a website. 
It eliminates the need for users to remember their passwords and provides an additional layer of security to the website.
The system is easy to use and can be integrated into any website that requires authentication. It is a great way to improve the user experience and enhance the security of the website.

# Outcome
## When non-user tries to enter using face-login.
